* Trying to collect data on citizens  
* Collection and selling of data  
  * Google is evil  
  * Similar to paper clip game  
  * Maybe a base builder aspect

Training data for AI \- you are a web crawler

* Get around all the anti web crawler things, navigate the www

* Bookshelves to fill by trading with other people

Debt/Tax collection  
Border patrol tariff collection simulator  
Pokemon

Bug collection \- game bugs  
Satire of board game where you collect victory points

**Factory game with data and your transforming data \- collecting data**  
Sell the data illegally to make extra mmoney  
Deidentify the data or not  
Follow the privacy priplujcaes or not privacy principles

Morality meter  
Quicktime events \- change the law, cyber attack, server burns down, clanker racism, ai rights  
Bribe the governement when they pass bad laws

Ask ai to make the factory lines pretend people personal data, pii, corporate information, activity information

* Depends on the source  
* Can deidentify if you wish

Sources

* Surveys  
* Web Tracking Data  
* CCTV  
* Clouds  
* Personal data (eg google home etc)  
* 

~~Basic types~~

- ~~Cant collect directly from sources, but you can split into them~~

**Basic Types:**

* **Biometric (A)**  
* **Economic (B)**  
* **Behavioural (C)**  
* **Telemetry (D)**

AI ideas:  
**Tier 1: Two-Type Combinations**  
A \+ B → Health Premium Scores (Corporate / Government)  
A \+ C → Lifestyle Profiles (Academia / Criminal)  
A \+ D → Bio-Tracking Streams (Academia / Government)  
B \+ C → Spending Behaviour Models (Corporate)  
B \+ D → Geo-Economic Trends (Corporate / Criminal)  
C \+ D → Mobility & Behaviour Logs (Academia / Government)

| Tier 1  | A | B | C | D |
| :---: | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** |  | Health Premium Scores (Corporate / Government) | Lifestyle profiles (Academia / Criminal) | Bio-Tracking Streams (Academia / Government) |
| **B** |  |  | Spending Behaviour Models (Corporate) | Geo-Economic trends (Corporate / Criminal) |
| **C** |  |  |  | Mobility & Behaviour Logs (Academia / Government)  |

A \+ C \+ D → Public Safety & Bio-Behavioural Tracking (Government/Academia)  
B \+ C \+ D → Full Consumer Journey Maps (Corporate/Criminal)

**Tier 3: Win the game?**  
A \+ B \+ C \+ D→ Total surveillance profile 

Existing dataset from factions :P

A+C+B

(AC)+ \= A+C+ ?

A+-C+B

Restrictions that apply on datasets \- combinations of basic types of data:  
Each base type only appears once, each augmentation appears either 0 or 1 time for each type  
Start with one augmentation type first

A  
AB  
A+C  
A+C+ \== (AC)+ \==C+A+  
ABC+  
A+B+C

Will splitters let you choose?  
Only use splitter of correct type

Combiners pretty chill can combine any which way, but add channel upgrades as well

Augmentor upgrade choose which channel to augment–

A+A-

Order does NOT matter

Transformers

* Combiners  
  * Data Linkage \- combines two data types together  
  * Data extraction \- extract specific things from data to split them up  
  * Data supplementation – ?  
* Changers  
  * De-identifier  
  * Regression Analysis/business analysis \- predictive model?  
  * Inputation?  
  * **Aggregator \- Aggregated \[source\]**  
  * **Cleaner \- Cleaned \[source\]**


  

Each source can be augmented into source+ \- we can have a couple of different augmented types

* Factions may have augmented, combined data of high throughput potentially

Combining and splitting \- include augmented sources  
Cutter \- same data, but half throughput  
Splitter \- turns data into two different types, half throughput each side

Duplicate data \- expensive late game \- data augmentation you can duplicate any type of product??

* Duplicator  
* Cleaners  
  * Impute  
  * 

Outputs (see input section)

* Academia/Research  
* Corporate  
* Government  
* Criminal  
  * Dark Web


Objectives

Upgrade paths/ options

* Encouraged to use one or the other depending on gameplay events

Depending on stuff your collecting you get different options

Bribe/agree/ignore with politicians etc

Big data bar

* But split into different data types

CONTRACTs to fill

* Get money through data  
* Criminal orgs, govt, corp, research \- at the end its all evil lol  
* Separate ethic orgs  
* Sell data illegally button

Contracts require data in a certain way \- you need to transform

- Sometimes contracts are just like need more data pls

Orgs on the map and feed to the orgs or drag objective locations on the map?

Economic victory, power victory \- criminal or government, 

Normal sources, high yield sources associated with factions  
Faction bubbles randomly on map, cannot access until conditions are met. Cannot even build there

Of course. Based on your detailed notes, I've structured and expanded your ideas into a formal game design concept document. This captures the essence of a factory/tycoon game built around the complex and morally ambiguous world of big data.

Game Design Concept: Data Tycoon

**1\. High Concept**

\*\*\`Data Tycoon\`\*\* is a simulation/management game where players build a data-processing empire from the ground up. In a world teetering on the edge of a surveillance society, you will acquire raw data, build complex processing pipelines to refine it into valuable intelligence products, and sell them to a variety of clients—from corporations and research institutions to governments and criminal syndicates. Every choice has a consequence, forcing you to navigate a web of ethical dilemmas, political intrigue, and technological challenges, all while balancing profit and privacy.

**2\. Core Gameplay Loop**

1\.  Acquire: Set up collectors to tap into various Data Sources (CCTV, Web Tracking, etc.).  
2\.  Process: Build a "factory" floor using a variety of machines (Splitters, Combiners, Augmentors, Cleaners, etc.) to transform raw data streams into specific, valuable *Data Products*.  
3\.  Fulfill: Take on \*\*Contracts\*\* from different Factions (Corporate, Government, Academia, Criminal) who demand specific types of data products.  
4\.  Profit & Upgrade: Use the profits to research new technologies, upgrade your machines, expand your infrastructure, and increase your influence.  
5\.  Navigate: Respond to Dynamic World Events, manage your reputation, and make key decisions that shape the world and your place in it.

**3\. Core Mechanics: The Data Factory**

**3.1. Data: The Core Resource**

Data flows through your factory like a resource on a conveyor belt. It has several key properties:

**A. Data Sources (Inputs):**  
You cannot create data from nothing. You must tap into sources, which produce a mix of basic data types.  
**You start with 4 basic sources (others are behind locked areas)**  
\*   Surveys:\*Produces Economic (B) and Behavioural (C) data. Low volume, high initial quality.  
\*   Web Tracking Data: Produces Economic (B), Behavioural (C), and Telemetry (D). High volume, medium quality.  
\*   CCTV Feeds: Produces Biometric (A), Behavioural (C), and Telemetry (D).  
\*   Cloud Services: Can produce any data type, depending on the service. Often high-value.  
\*   Personal Devices (IoT): Produces all four types (A, B, C, D). Extremely valuable but carries high legal/ethical risk.

B. Basic Data Types:  
All data can be broken down into four fundamental types.  
\*   \`A\`: Biometric (facial recognition, DNA, health metrics)  
\*   \`B\`: Economic (income, credit score, purchase history)  
\*   \`C\`: Behavioural (habits, social circles, political leanings)  
\*   \`D\`: Telemetry (location history, movement speed, device usage)

C. Data Attributes (Modifiers):  
Data streams can be modified with attributes that change their value and legality. Order does not matter.  
Aggregated (\`+\`): The data has been enriched and cross-referenced, making it significantly more valuable. Example: \`A+\`.  
De-Identified (\`(\*)\`): Personal Identifiable Information (PII) has been stripped. This makes the data legal to sell in most contexts but less valuable to certain clients (e.g., Criminals). It may also reduce its utility for combination.

Example Data Stream:  
A+\*BC+ represents a data product containing:  
\*   Augmented, de-identified Biometric data  
\*   Standard Economic data  
\*   Augmented Telemetry data 

3.2. Processors (Machines)

You build your factory by connecting these machines.  
\*   **Categoriser**: **2, 3, 4 way Categoriser** Takes a Data Source (e.g., \`Web Tracking\`) and splits it into its component types (\`B\`, \`C\`, and \`D\`), with throughput divided among the outputs.  
\*   **Combiner**: Takes two or more different data type streams (e.g., \`A\` and \`B\`) and merges them into a combined product (\`AB\`). Requires R\&D for more than two inputs.

- **Splitter**: splits a data stream into two equal parts

\*   **Aggregator**: Takes a data stream and adds the Augmented (\`+\`) attribute to one data type within it.   
\*   **De-Identifier**: Adds the De-Identified (\`\*\`) attribute to a data stream. Reduces "Heat" and illegal status but may lower its sale price.  
\*   **Duplicator:** An expensive, late-game machine that can perfectly clone a finished data product, creating two identical output streams from one input **(Criminal faction unlock)**  
\*   **Cutter**: Splits a single data stream into two identical-but-halved-throughput streams, allowing you to route a product to two different clients or processors.

3.3. Data Products (Outputs for Factions) **Contracts**

Combining basic data types creates valuable intelligence products for different clients.

\*\*Tier 1: Two-Type Combinations\*\*  
\*   \`A+B\`: \*\*Health Premium Scores\*\* (For Corporate, Government)  
\*   \`A+C\`: \*\*Lifestyle Profiles\*\* (For Academia, Criminals)  
\*   \`A+D\`: \*\*Bio-Tracking Streams\*\* (For Academia, Government)  
\*   \`B+C\`: \*\*Spending Behaviour Models\*\* (For Corporate)  
\*   \`B+D\`: \*\*Geo-Economic Trends\*\* (For Corporate, Criminals)  
\*   \`C+D\`: \*\*Mobility & Behaviour Logs\*\* (For Academia, Government)

\*\*Tier 2: Three-Type Combinations\*\*  
\*   \`A+B+C\`: \*\*Cohort Risk Index\*\* (For Academia, Corporate)  
\*   \`A+B+D\`: \*\*Smart City Registry / Ransomware Target List\*\* (For Government, Criminals)  
\*   \`A+C+D\`: \*\*Public Safety Bio-Behavioural Tracks\*\* (For Government, Academia)  
\*   \`B+C+D\`: \*\*Full Consumer Journey Map\*\* (For Corporate, Criminals)

\*\*Tier 3: The Endgame\*\*  
\*   \`A+B+C+D\`: \*\*Total Information Profile.\*\* The ultimate data product; a complete digital ghost of an individual or group. This is a key objective for achieving a victory condition.

**4\. The Reputation & Event System**

4.1. Upgrade/Reputation system

**Upgrade system**  
General upgrade tree that focuses on unlocking machines, increased storage. 5 tiers, unlocked by 

**Reputation:**  
**There are 4 reputation ratings based on the factions, with 6 tiers. Hostile / Untrusted / Neutral / Friendly / Trusted / Exclusive.** 

1. Corporate (contract perks)  
2. Academia (upgrade perks)  
3. Government (power/control perks)   
4. Criminal (efficiency/cheating)

These are influenced by contracts and world events. Players only see the message ‘Your reputation within the *corporate* sector is now *friendly*’

All reputations start at 40

| Score Range | Tier Name | Perks  | Corporate | Academia | Government | Criminal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0–15** | **Hostile** |  | **All temporary contracts are gone, all contracts pay \-50%** | **Machines cost 25% more. Cannot buy T3 and above upgrades.** | **National lockdown: Government and Academia contracts become locked. Increase chance of BAD events** | **Criminal and Corporate contracts become locked. Increase chance of BAD events.** |
| **16–30** | **Untrusted** |  | **Corporate contracts pay \-50%** | **Upgrades cost \+20%** | **Government contracts occur 20% less.** | **Increased chance of bad events.** |
| **31–45** | **Neutral** |  |  |  |  |  |
| **46–60** | **Friendly** |  | **Corporate contracts pay \+25%** | **Upgrades cost \-15%** | **Government contracts occur 25% more often.**  | **Dark web contract available (connect to sell any data at a cheap price).** |
| **61–80** | **Trusted** |  | **All contracts pay \+10%, additional contracts spawn 10% more frequently** | **Upgrades cost \-50%, corporate contracts spawn less, academic contracts spawn more, pay \+50%** | **You can block criminal and corporate contracts. Government contracts pay \+50%** | **Unlock black market: can buy machines at 10-100% off (RNG).**  |
| **81–100** | **Exclusive** |  | **Market monopoly: \+100% payout, contracts immediately respawn** | **ProfessoR: Upgrades before T4 become free. Unlock the T5 upgrades,** | **Nationalist: Add 4 national secret deals (permanent, high payout). Criminal reputation set to 0\.** | **Syndicate: Unlock all sources, increase dark web pay \+500%. Government reputation set to 0\.** |
